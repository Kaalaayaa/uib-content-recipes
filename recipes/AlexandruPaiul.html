    <h1>Mamaliga</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cornmeal - 400g</li>
        <li>Water - 1.5L</li>
        <li>Salt - 1tsp</li>
        <li>Butter or olive oil - 1tbsp</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Traditionally, mămăligă is cooked by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped cast iron pot called ceaun or tuci</li>
        <li>When cooked peasant-style and used as a bread substitute, mămăligă is supposed to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta to the point that it can be cut in slices, like bread.</li>
        <li>When cooked for other purposes, mămăligă can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. </li>
        <li>Because mămăligă sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread is used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread.</li>
