        <h1>Blissed-Out Thai Salad with Peanut Tempeh by Minimalist Baker</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <div class="sub-header">SALAD</div>
                    <li>6 ounces vermicelli noodles (I like brown rice noodles)</li>
                    <li>2 medium whole carrots, "ribboned" with a vegetable peeler or spiralizer</li>
                    <li>2 stalks green onions (finely chopped)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
                    <li>2-3 Tbsp chopped mint</li>
                    <li>1 cup loosely packed spinach (chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 cup thinly sliced red cabbage</li>
                    <li>1 medium red bell pepper (thinly sliced)</li>
                    <li>1 batch Marinated Peanut Tempeh (optional)</li>

            </ul>
            <ul>       

                <div class="sub-header">DRESSING</div>

                    <li>1/3 cup salted creamy peanut butter, almond butter, or sunbutter (plus 1 extra Tbsp as original recipe is written)</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp gluten-free tamari (or soy sauce if not GF)</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1 tsp chili garlic sauce (or sub 1 red Thai chili minced // or 1/4 tsp red pepper flake // amounts as original recipe is written)</li>
                    <li>1 medium lime, juiced (yields ~3 Tbsp or 45 ml)</li>
                    <li>~1/4 cup water (to thin)</li>

            </ul>

            
        <h2>Preparation</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Cook rice noodles according to package instructions, rinse, drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>To a large serving bowl, add cooked and cooled noodles, carrots, green onions, cilantro, mint, spinach, cabbage, and red bell pepper and toss loosely to combine. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make dressing by adding peanut butter, tamari, maple syrup, chili sauce (or chili or red pepper), and lime juice to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Then add warm water a little at a time until a thick but pourable sauce is achieved.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, chili sauce (chili or red pepper) for heat, lime juice for acidity, or tamari for saltiness. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add 1/2 of the tempeh (optional) and 1/2 of the sauce to the salad and toss. Then top with remaining tempeh and sauce. Serve immediately. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, though best when fresh. I find that, if making ahead of time, it's better to leave the salad undressed and store the tempeh separately.</li>
            </ol>
