        <ul>
            <li>4 unripe plantains</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li> 4 tsp olive oil or butter</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peeling: Peel the plantains and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two. Remove the center where
                the
                seeds are located (optional, this is just my preference for a smoother mang√∫).</li>
            <li>Boiling: Boil the plantains in enough water to cover them plus an inch until they are very tender,
                having added
                the salt to the water before the water breaks the boil.</li>
            <li> Mashing: Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very
                smooth
                and there are few to no lumps (be careful not to burn yourself). Mix in olive oil, and water at room
                temperature
                and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a smooth puree.</li>
            <li>Serving: Garnish mangu with sauted onions and serve with sunny-side-up eggs</li>

        </ol>
