            <li> 2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, reduce or omit if sensitive to spice</li>
            <li>1 large can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley, plus addition cilantro or parsley leaves for garnish</li>
            <li>5 to 6 large eggs</li>
            <li> ½ cup crumbled feta</li>

           
            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
            <ol>

                <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Warm the oil in a large, <br>
                    oven-safe skillet (preferably stainless steel) over medium heat. Once shimmering, <br>
                    add the onion, bell pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring often, <br>
                    until the onions are tender and turning translucent, about 4 to 6 minutes.  </li>  <br>
                <li>Add the garlic, tomato paste, cumin, paprika and red pepper flakes. Cook, <br>
                     stirring constantly, until nice and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. </li><br>
                <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes with their juices and add the cilantro.<br>
                    Stir, and let the mixture come to a simmer. Reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer,
                    and cook for 5 minutes to give the flavors time to meld.</li><br>
                <li>Carefully transfer the skillet to the oven (it’s heavy) and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, <br>
                    checking often once you reach 8 minutes.<br>
                     They’re done when the egg whites are an opaque white and the yolks have risen a bit but are still soft.<br>
                    They should still jiggle in the centers when you shimmy the pan. <br>
                    (Keep in mind that they’ll continue cooking after you pull the dish out of the oven.)</li> <br>
                <li>Using oven mitts (both hands!), transfer the hot skillet to a heat-safe surface like the stove. <br>
                    Top with the crumbled feta, fresh cilantro leaves, and more red pepper flakes, <br>
                    if desired. Serve in bowls with crusty bread on the side.<br>
                </li>
                <br>

</ol>
